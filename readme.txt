The piece of material is defined by the following set of parameters:

(h0, d0, w0, ..., h(k-1), d(k-1), w(k-1))

for k layers numbered from 0 to k - 1
hi - the ordinate of the i-th layer, 
di - displacement of the first atom in the layer, 
wi - interatomic distance in the layer.

with one exception: h0 stores the distance between periodic slices, i.e. between -1 and 0 layers
(zero layer has 0 ordinate)
